[![Tests](https://github.com/Hambaobao/httpkit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hambaobao/httpkit/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A collection of HTTP-related utilities and tools.

## Installation

```bash
pip install httpkit
```

## Tools

### HTTP Proxy

A simple HTTP proxy service that forwards requests to a target server.

#### Usage

You can run the proxy server in several ways:

1. Using the module directly:

```bash
python -m httpkit.proxy
```

2. Using the entry point:

```bash
httpkit-proxy
```

3. Using uvicorn directly:

```bash
uvicorn httpkit.proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Making Requests

Once the proxy server is running, you can make requests to it using the following URL patterns:

```
http://localhost:8000/proxy/{target_host}:{target_port}/{path}
```

Or with explicit scheme:

```
http://localhost:8000/proxy/{scheme}://{target_host}:{target_port}/{path}
```

For example, to forward a request to `http://localhost:9000/health`:

```
http://localhost:8000/proxy/localhost:9000/health
```

Or with HTTPS:

```
http://localhost:8000/proxy/https://api.example.com:443/v1/chat/completions
```

The proxy will preserve:
- HTTP method
- Headers (except hop-by-hop and unsafe ones)
- Query parameters
- Request body

#### Performance Optimizations

The proxy includes several optimizations for high-concurrency scenarios:

1. **Global Connection Pooling**: Uses a single global httpx.AsyncClient for connection reuse
2. **Streaming Responses**: Streams responses back to clients without buffering the entire content
3. **Concurrency Control**: Limits the number of concurrent requests to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **HTTP/2 Support**: Enables HTTP/2 for better performance with many persistent connections
5. **Header Filtering**: Properly filters unsafe or conflicting response headers

#### Configuration

The proxy can be configured using command-line arguments or environment variables:

##### Command-line Arguments

```bash
# Start proxy allowing up to 500 concurrent connections,
# with a 60-second HTTP/2 timeout
httpkit-proxy --max-concurrent-requests 500 --timeout 60
```

##### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the proxy:

- `HTTPKIT_ENV`: Set to "production" to disable auto-reload (default: "development")
- `HTTPKIT_WORKERS`: Number of worker processes to use (default: 1)
- `HTTPKIT_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`: Maximum number of concurrent requests (default: 100)
- `HTTPKIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: HTTP client timeout in seconds (default: 30.0)

## Development
